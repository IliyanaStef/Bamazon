Description:

This application implements a simple command line based storefront using the npm inquirer package and the MySQL database backend together with the npm mysql package. 
The application presents two interfaces: customer and manager.

The customer interface allows the user to view the current inventory of store items: item IDs, descriptions, department in which the item is located and price. 
The user is then able to purchase one of the existing items by entering the item ID and the desired quantity. 

Manager Interface:

The manager interface presents a list of four options: view products for sale, view low inventory, add to inventory, add new product.
